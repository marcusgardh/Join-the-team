# Read me

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setting up

Run `npm install` before trying other scripts. `npm install` installs all required dependencies.

`npm start` starts the application on `http://localhost:3000`. (run after `npm install`)
